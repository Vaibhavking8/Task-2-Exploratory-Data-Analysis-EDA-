# Task-2-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to passenger survival.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Titanic passenger data (CSV format)
- **Features Used**: `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Age`, `Fare`, `SibSp`, `Parch`

## Analysis Tasks
1. **Summary Statistics**  
   - Mean, median, standard deviation, min, max for numeric features.

2. **Visualizations**  
   - Histograms and boxplots for each numeric column.
   - Correlation matrix heatmap to explore feature relationships.
   - Pairplot (grouped by `Survived`) to observe patterns.

3. **Insights & Inferences**
   - Survival is influenced by `Pclass`, `Fare`, and `Age`.
   - Outliers exist in `Fare`, `SibSp`, and `Parch`.
   - Higher survival chances are noted for younger passengers and those in 1st class.
